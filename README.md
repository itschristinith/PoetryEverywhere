PoetryEverywhere
================

My two projects for that class can be found here. Both are JS applications. 
Anxiety Ants is an application that create a javascript script on top of any page where you are at. 
It is meant to fill your screen with ants and it can be used by making a botton in your bookmarks and adding the path. 

Poetry Pots is a building projection I worked on with Christina Carter. It is a python app running a script to search twitter for 
people tweeting @poetrypots. The poetry would show up on the building and make a flower appear, for each tweet.
